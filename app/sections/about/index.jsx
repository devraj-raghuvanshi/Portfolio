							I enjoy learning technologies that interest me, which is why I dedicated a significant
							amount of time to working with NextJS.
						</p>
						<p>
							One day, I decided to try something new, and I started learning React. I was so
							excited to see how fast I can build a website with it, and how easy it is to maintain
							it. Consequently, I quickly learnt Next.js and I used it to build some company
							projects working in a team.

							In december 2023, I had an opportunity to start working as a Full-Stack developer for
							ZomatoüçÖ as Intern with the possibility of transitioning to AWS. I was skeptical
							about it at first, but I decided to give it a try, and I don&lsquo;t regret it. Now, I
							thoroughly enjoy working with FullStack.
